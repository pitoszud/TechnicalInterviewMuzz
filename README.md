# Muzz chat app challenge

### Architecture

MVVM, multi-modules with clean architecture and unidirectional data flow.
- Jetpack Compose for UI
- Room for caching
- Ktor client network (fetching from network not required)
- Kotlin serialization


### Notes

- The app does not connect to network - there is only a dummy reply to each sent message.
- It's a simple chat, so there is no paging
